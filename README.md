# course_registration

A simple bot that enables automated enrollment in classes, as well as accessing current enrollment information. Only implemented this for fun, should not be used
for actual enrollment without permission (?) Also no option for scheduling enrollment is implemented.

```
python make_request.py --enroll
access.caltech username: 
access.caltech password:
Enter course: BEM 110
Adding Class BEM 110
```

The above should open a Selenium webbrowser proxy with the course details filled in
